# Guessing Game Javascript
Simple number guessing game built in JavaScript. The user is prompted to enter a maximum number and the game generates a random target number within that range. The user then guesses the target number with the game providing feedback on whether the guess is too high or low. The game ends when the user correctly guesses or quits by entering 'q'.
